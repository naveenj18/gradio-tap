In this video, if you're a non-technical founder, I'm going to tell you how you could build your MVP or your product without hiring a dedicated full-time CTO. Hi, I'm Murtaza. I'm one of the founders of F22 Labs. And over the last 10 years, we've worked with hundreds of non-technical founders, helped them build their product that have gone on to raise millions of dollars in funding by being their remote technical team and the remote CTOs. So, first of all, why shouldn't you hire a dedicated full-time CTO to build your product? Number one, it doesn't really require a full-time CTO at this early stage. Number two, building a product requires multiple skill sets. If you're building an application, you need a mobile developer, you need a backend developer, you need a cloud developer. And it's going to be quite rare to find one person who can do all of these jobs. Even if you do, it's going to take you a lot more time if one person has to build out the entire product. And you might also need a good designer, which is quite unlikely that a good CTO would have design skills as well. Number three, if someone's coming in as a CTO at an early stage, you're going to be giving away a lot of equity, which is precious. Number four, you'll have to convince someone who's a CTO or CTO level to believe in your idea, to believe in your vision. And it's going to be hard for them to commit to something so early at this stage because there is nothing. There is no proof of work. There is no value that they would see in just the idea at this point. So if you're not going to hire a dedicated CTO, then how are you going to build a product? Well, there are three ways you could do that. Number one, you could learn to build the product yourself. If it's simple, you could use no code tools and build a very simple version out. Number two, you could hire freelance engineers. There are lots of sites where you could hire them from. For example, there's Fiverr, there's Upwork, there's Toptal. There's a whole range and variety of engineers available for hire. Or number three and a more reliable option is to work with a good quality outsourced agency that has the skill sets, that has the experience of building a product like the one you want. Now, in my next video, I'll tell you why working with an outsourced development agency is a good option. But until then, if you are stuck or if you know someone who's stuck at this stage where they're looking for a CTO to move forward in their journey of building their product, tag them in the comments below. Until then, take care.",,,2024-02-27 09:41:08.589283
